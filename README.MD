Tax Sales are an important concept in the housing industry. Properties whose property taxes are not paid off are auctioned in a monthly tax sale,
akin to how bank foreclose houses based on mortgages not being paid off. Local counties post the information about tax sales on their website or in the 
local newspaper, however, all information is usually sent out in one large string of text. In order to make viewing properties and information easier, this
program makes it very easy to view the information, parsing out each property's important characteristics.

How to use: just run the python file for the respective county and it should generate a excel file with all information parsed out
